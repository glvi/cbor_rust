CBOR decoder in Rust

I started this project for educational purposes. Primarily, I wanted to educate myself in the use of Rust. I was dealing a lot with CBOR at the time. So that seemed like an obvious choice.

Starting point is a simple CBOR decoder for use with a serial line. The CBOR decoder consumes a byte at a time, and at the same time builds an in-memory structured CBOR representation.

More use cases may followâ€¦
